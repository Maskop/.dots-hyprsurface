# surface-shell
## Intro
> This is a graduation project for my school. I want to make a hyprland rice that will be very usable on yoga/surface like desktops. I will be developing this on surface pro 7+ with arch installed and my plan is to integrate with the pen and more. This rice will have touch centered ui with a catch... I don't like mouse/touch centered UI that much. So I will be also making a toggle, that transforms the UI for keyboard-centered UI.
## Overview
### Features 
- Touch centered UI (Not yet)
- Toggle for desktop mode (Not yet)
- On-screen keyboard (Not yet)
- Pen support - Surface pen (Not yet)
## What I mean when I say
### Touch centered UI

>  Touch centered IU is when you don't need to take out your keyboard to do things in the system.

- Bar above apps for moving them and closing them.
- The apps are tiling, in bar the option to un-tile.
- The main bar has notification center, clock, calendar, button for opening app menu and running apps.
- Gestures for bringing up UI elements such as: MENU, Volume and such
### Desktop mode
- Is less UI cluttered (Smaller icons, etc.)
- Is much more keyboard centered
### Pen support
- The pen senses pressure
- You can set custom actions for pen button
